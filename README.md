# MultiplayerFinalProject
My semester long project for IGME 690 in Fall 2021



## Milestone 1

Currently I have finished up what I set out to do for this milestone and I have started working on tasks for the second milestone.

To run this milestone just load up Unity and open up the SinglePlayer scene to test out the first milestone's functionallity.

Controls:
 - W - To jump
 - A - To move left
 - D - To move right
 - Left Mouse Button - Fire weapon

The Player is the white rectangle and the weapon is the smaller yellow square on the side of them.
The single red square in the level is the target that the player will have to hit with their weapon to grab.

I have started working on the multiplayer aspects of the project as well however they are not fully implemented. I am planning on using Mirror within this project however I am still learning it's structure and may switch over to Unity's Multiplayer API if I run into too many issues. https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/mirror-129321
